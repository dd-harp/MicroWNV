- title: Bloodmeal
  desc: >
    The bloodmeal function computes bites taken by mosquitoes on hosts relevant
    for pathogen transmission between species over a time step. After it is computed, the various
    components can be updated independently. This function overrides `compute_bloodmeal`
    from **Micro-MoB**

    Certain S3 methods are overridden to account for specific behavior for West Nile virus.

- title: Adult bird component

  desc: >
    The adult bird component is responsible for updating adult bird populations
    and their pathogen dynamics. Any model of adult birds in MicroWNV is required to
    implement the following interface methods.

- subtitle: SIRS adult bird model
  desc: >
    This model implements a simple SIRS model of adult birds with risk distributed
    accross a "home range".

- title: Fledgling (immature) bird component

  desc: >
    The fledgling component is responsible for updating fledgling bird
    populations which live in nests. It must calculate how many eggs clutches
    are laid by adults per day, add them to nests, update the fledglings, and calculate
    the number of new adults. Any model of fledglings in MicroWNV is required to
    implement the following interface methods.
  contents:
    - step_fledge
    - compute_fledge

- subtitle: Trace (forced) fledgling model
  desc: >
    This is a model of fledglings where birth is passed as a trace (forcing)
    term and it is not affected by endogenous dynamics.
