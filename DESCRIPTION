Description: MicroWNV provides a framework based on S3 dispatch for constructing models
  of West Nile virus (WNV) transmission which are constructed from submodels of various
  components (i.e. birds, mosquitoes, humans, pathogen). It imports the MicroMoB
  package, which provides core algorithms and data structures for mosquito-borne
  pathogen transmission; MicroWNV adds a bird component and a modified bloodmeal
  algorithm to account for biting on birds.
