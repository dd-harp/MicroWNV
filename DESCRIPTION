Description: MicroWNV provides a framework based on S3 dispatch for constructing models
  of West Nile virus transmission which are constructed from submodels of various
  components (i.e. birds, mosquitoes, humans, pathogen). A consistent mathematical
  expression for the distribution of bites on hosts means that different models
  (stochastic, deterministic, etc.) can be coherently incorporated and updated
  over a discrete time step.
